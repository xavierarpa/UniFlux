## Changed
We modify the namespacing from "namespace Kingdox.UniFlux" to "namespace UniFlux". WARNING THIS MEANS A BREAKING CHANGES

## [1.3.1] - 2023-04-30

### Fixed
- Fixed Internal.State to invoke in store if it was dispatched before

## [1.3.0] - 2023-04-23

### Added
- Added FluxState, State and StateFlux to handle Store with State
- Added in Core.Flux StoreState and DispatchState to handle State Management methods
- implemented StoreState and DispatchState in extensions

### Experimental
- Allowing use of Scriptable objects as Key to Store and Dispatch. this allow modules become more modular, but also brings more boilerplate

### Removed
- removed dictionary_read for ActionFluxParam

## [1.2.2] - 2023-04-20

### Fixed
- The FuncFlux and FuncFluxParam as design is planned to only add one per key, but you can add multiple keys instead, thats why we reduce the complexity of optimization to just use Func< TResult > as TStorage

### Removed
- Removed dictionary_read in ActionFlux, ActionFluxParam, FuncFlux and FuncFluxParam

## [1.2.1] - 2023-04-17

### Fixed
- The Store methods have been fixed so that when unsubscribing they remove it from the storage, before it allowed to add the first one but not to subscribe or unsubscribe the following ones.

Now UniFlux is more optimized than before

### Added

- Added in FuncParamFLux dictionary_read for optimization purposes

### Removed
- Removed Dictionary contract in IStore
- Removed Test PlayMode for no test included yet

### Optimized
- Optimized Dispatching from ~100.000 iteration string key => 25ms to ~15ms
- Optimized Storing Add from ~10.000 iteration string key => [300ms GC.Alloc 380MB] to [~15ms GC.Alloc 2.9MB]
- Optimized Storing Remove from ~10.000 iteration string key => [300ms GC.Alloc 380MB] to [~15ms GC.Alloc 2.9MB]
